# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer
This is a Deep Learning Model used to do Multiclass Classification of the Handwritten Digit given by user.
Key Features of the model:
In this project, I have used ANN (Artificial Neural Network) concepts of Deep Learning to make this model recognize handwritten digits.
This model uses Deep Learning concepts to do a multiclass classification of the handwritten digit given by user and predicts the given digit is which one of the 10 digits(0-9).
This model is useful in solving real-life problems & consequences in computer vision, banking sector & associated fields.
